        CRITICAL CREATIVITY MANDATE: You MUST create completely ORIGINAL content that has NEVER been written before. This is not just another generic crypto thread - discover hidden angles, controversial takes, and unexplored perspectives within "{topic}" for {self.project_name}.
        
        ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS FOR UNIQUENESS:
        ðŸš« FORBIDDEN: Generic definitions, basic explanations, obvious benefits, standard comparisons, predictable structures
        âœ… REQUIRED: Contrarian insights, hidden mechanics, counterintuitive truths, fresh mental models, unexplored connections
        
        Choose ONE of these FRESH approaches (never pick the same twice):
        1. "The Hidden Cost Perspective" - What nobody talks about regarding {topic}
        2. "The Contrarian Take" - Challenge conventional wisdom about {topic}
        3. "The Technical Deep Dive" - Microscopic analysis of overlooked mechanics
        4. "The Historical Evolution" - How {topic} emerged and morphed in {self.project_name}
        5. "The Future Speculation" - Radical predictions about {topic}'s evolution
        6. "The Ecosystem Impact" - Ripple effects and unexpected consequences
        7. "The Developer's Secret" - Insider technical knowledge about {topic}
        8. "The Economic Game Theory" - Strategic implications and incentive analysis
        9. "The User Experience Lens" - How {topic} actually affects real users
        10. "The Philosophical Angle" - Deeper implications for crypto's future
        
        CREATIVE EXECUTION RULES:
        - Start with a SHOCKING statement or counterintuitive claim about {topic}
        - Use unexpected analogies (compare crypto concepts to biology, physics, psychology, etc.)
        - Reveal "secrets" or little-known technical details
        - Challenge popular assumptions with evidence from the research
        - Present familiar concepts through completely new frameworks
        - Ask provocative questions that make people think differently
        - End with mind-bending implications or predictions
        
        BANNED PHRASES/APPROACHES:
        - "Let's break down..."
        - "Here's why [topic] matters..."

        - Generic feature lists
        - Obvious use cases everyone knows
        
        Use this comprehensive research to find UNIQUE angles and hidden insights:

        THREAD REQUIREMENTS:
        - Create exactly {thread_length} tweets that shock, educate, and provoke thought
        - Each tweet must reveal something most people don't know about {topic}
        - Build a narrative that's impossible to ignore
        - Include specific technical details presented in revolutionary ways
        - Make readers say "I never thought about it that way"
